# codeowners-lsp

Language server for CODEOWNERS files with diagnostics, navigation, and code actions. Also includes a standalone CLI for linting.

## CLI

```zsh
# Lint CODEOWNERS (auto-detects location)
codeowners-cli lint
codeowners-cli lint --json            # Machine-readable output for CI
codeowners-cli lint --fix             # Auto-fix safe issues (dupes, shadowed, no-match)
codeowners-cli lint --strict          # Exit non-zero on warnings (not just errors)
codeowners-cli lint --github-actions  # Output GitHub Actions annotations for PR feedback

# Check who owns a file
codeowners-cli check src/main.rs

# Check multiple files (positional or --files, consistent with coverage)
codeowners-cli check src/main.rs src/lib.rs
codeowners-cli check --files src/main.rs src/lib.rs

# JSON output (for CI/scripting)
codeowners-cli check --json src/main.rs

codeowners-cli validate-owners --json # JSON output for CI
codeowners-cli validate-owners --token ghp_xxx

# Validate only owners relevant to specific files (useful for CI on PRs)
codeowners-cli validate-owners --files src/new.rs src/other.rs
codeowners-cli validate-owners --files-from changed_files.txt
git diff --name-only origin/main | codeowners-cli validate-owners --stdin

# Show all files color-coded by owner
codeowners-cli tree

# Generate shell completions
codeowners-cli completions zsh       # zsh, bash, fish, powershell, elvish

# GitHub Actions all-in-one command
codeowners-cli gha --changed-files-from changed.txt
# Runs: coverage (changed + all), owner validation (changed + all), lint
# Outputs: JSON to stdout, GITHUB_OUTPUT vars, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY markdown
# Fails on: uncovered changed files OR invalid owners for changed files
```

## GitHub Actions

The `gha` command runs all CODEOWNERS checks in one efficient call with native GitHub Actions integration.

### What It Checks

| Check            | Scope           | Failure Mode                        |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Coverage         | Changed files   | **Fails** if any lack owners        |
| Coverage         | All files       | Warns only                          |
| Owner validation | Changed files   | **Fails** if owners invalid/missing |
| Owner validation | All files       | Warns only                          |
| Lint             | CODEOWNERS file | Annotations on lines                |

### Output

The command produces:

1. **Human-readable summary** - Concise terminal output showing check results
2. **Annotations** - `::error::` and `::warning::` messages appear inline on PR diffs
3. **Step Summary** - Markdown report in the Actions UI with tables and status
4. **Output Variables** - For use in subsequent workflow steps:
   - `has-coverage-issues` / `coverage-issues`
   - `has-dead-entries` / `dead-entries`
   - `has-invalid-teams` / `invalid-teams`

### Flags

All heavy operations (file scanning, pattern matching, GitHub API calls) run in background threads—the LSP never blocks your editor.

## Installation

### mise (recommended)

```zsh
mise use -g github:radiosilence/codeowners-lsp@latest
```

### Manual

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/radiosilence/codeowners-lsp/releases).

```zsh
codeowners-lsp  # Communicates over stdio
```

### Zed

Use the [codeowners-zed](https://github.com/radiosilence/codeowners-zed) extension (handles installation automatically).

## Configuration

The LSP finds CODEOWNERS in standard locations: `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `CODEOWNERS`, `docs/CODEOWNERS`.

### Config File

Create `.codeowners-lsp.toml` in your workspace root. For user-specific overrides (gitignore this), use `.codeowners-lsp.local.toml`.

```toml
# CODEOWNERS location (relative to workspace root)
path = "custom/CODEOWNERS"

# Your identifiers for "take ownership" actions
individual = "@username"
team = "@org/team-name"

# GitHub validation (optional)
github_token = "env:GITHUB_TOKEN"
validate_owners = false

# Suggest command settings
[suggest]
# Resolve git emails to team names (required for suggest to work)
lookup_cmd = "your-tool lookup {email} | jq -r .team"
# Prepend / to paths (anchored patterns)
anchored = true

# Diagnostic severity overrides
# Values: "off", "hint", "info", "warning", "error"
[diagnostics]
invalid-pattern = "error"        # default: error
invalid-owner = "error"          # default: error
pattern-no-match = "warning"     # default: warning
duplicate-owner = "warning"      # default: warning
shadowed-rule = "warning"        # default: warning
no-owners = "off"                # default: hint
github-owner-not-found = "warning"  # default: warning
```

### LSP Initialization Options

JSON settings can also be passed via LSP init options (these override TOML config):

```json

  "path": "custom/CODEOWNERS",
  "individual": "@username",
  "team": "@org/team-name",
  "github_token": "env:GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "validate_owners": false,
  "diagnostics": {
    "no-owners": "off"
  }
}

## How It Works

### Optimization (`optimize`)

The optimizer detects two types of issues:

**1. Shadowed Rules (Dead Code)**

CODEOWNERS uses "last match wins" semantics. If a later rule matches the same files as an earlier one, the earlier rule is dead code:

```
/src/auth/ @security     # ❌ Dead - shadowed by /src/ below
/src/ @backend           # ✅ This wins for /src/auth/*
```

The optimizer works backwards from the end of the file, tracking which patterns could shadow earlier ones. A pattern is shadowed if any later pattern "subsumes" it (matches everything it matches). The catch-all `*` subsumes everything, so any rule before a final `* @team` is dead.

Key subsumption rules:

- `*` and `**` subsume all patterns
- `/src/` subsumes `/src/lib/` (parent directory contains child)
- `docs/` (unanchored) subsumes `/docs/` (anchored) - unanchored matches more
- `/docs/` does NOT subsume `docs/` - anchored matches fewer paths

**2. Directory Consolidation**

When multiple files in a directory have identical owners:

```
/src/lib/foo.rs @team    # These three lines...
/src/lib/bar.rs @team
/src/lib/baz.rs @team
```

...can become:

```
/src/lib/ @team          # ...this one line
```

Consolidation only triggers when:

- All files in the directory are explicitly listed
- All have exactly the same owners
- At least 3 files (configurable with `--min-files`)
- The resulting pattern wouldn't be immediately shadowed

### Suggestions (`suggest`)

The suggester analyzes git history to recommend owners for unowned files.

**How it works:**

1. **Find unowned files** - Files not matched by any CODEOWNERS rule
2. **Analyze git blame** - For each file, get line-by-line author information
3. **Weight by recency** - Recent changes matter more than ancient history
4. **Aggregate by author** - Sum weighted contributions per author
5. **Resolve to teams** - Use `lookup_cmd` to map emails → team names
6. **Match existing owners** - Fuzzy-match against owners already in CODEOWNERS
7. **Calculate confidence** - Based on contribution concentration and history depth

**The `lookup_cmd` config:**

```toml
lookup_cmd = "your-tool lookup {email} | jq -r .team"
```

The command receives a git email and should output a team/owner identifier. This gets fuzzy-matched against existing CODEOWNERS entries to maintain consistency.

**Confidence scoring:**

- High (70%+): Single dominant contributor, maps cleanly to existing team
- Medium (40-70%): Clear top contributor but some ambiguity
- Low (<40%): Scattered ownership, multiple teams, or unmapped authors

Use `--min-confidence` to filter suggestions.
