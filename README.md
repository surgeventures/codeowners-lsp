codeowners-cli lint --json  # Machine-readable output for CI

# Check who owns a file

codeowners-cli coverage

# Format CODEOWNERS file
codeowners-cli fmt                    # Prints formatted output

## LSP Features

### In Any File

- **Hover**: Shows file ownership when hovering over any code
- **Inlay Hints**: Displays ownership at the top of each file
- **Go-to-Definition**: Jump to the CODEOWNERS rule that matches the current file

  - Invalid owner format (@user, @org/team, or email)
  - Patterns matching no files
  - Duplicate/shadowed rules (dead code)
  - Rules with no owners
  - Coverage: count of files without owners
- **Completions**:
  - Path completions as you type (trigger: `/`)
  - Owner completions from GitHub API (trigger: `@`, requires `validate_owners`)
- **Inlay Hints**: Shows how many files each pattern matches
- **Code Actions**:
  - Remove shadowed rules
  - Remove duplicate owners
  - Add owner to empty rules
  - Add catch-all rule for unowned files
