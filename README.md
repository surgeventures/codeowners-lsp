## LSP Features

### In Any File

- **Hover**: Shows file ownership with clickable links to GitHub profiles/teams
- **Inlay Hints**: Displays ownership at the top of each file
- **Go-to-Definition**: Jump to the CODEOWNERS rule that matches the current file
- **Code Actions**: Take ownership of files directly from your editor

### In CODEOWNERS File

- **Diagnostics**:
  - Invalid glob patterns
  - Invalid owner format (@user, @org/team, or email)
  - Patterns matching no files
  - Duplicate/shadowed rules (dead code)
  - Rules with no owners
  - Coverage: count of files without owners
- **Completions**:
  - Path completions as you type (trigger: `/`)
  - Owner completions from GitHub API (trigger: `@`, requires `validate_owners`)
- **Inlay Hints**: Shows how many files each pattern matches
- **Code Actions**:
  - Remove shadowed rules
  - Remove duplicate owners
  - Add owner to empty rules
  - Add catch-all rule for unowned files
- **GitHub Validation** (optional): Validates users/teams exist on GitHub
