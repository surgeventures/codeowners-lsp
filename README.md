# codeowners-lsp

Language server for CODEOWNERS files with diagnostics, navigation, and code actions. Also includes a standalone CLI for linting.

## CLI

```zsh
# Lint CODEOWNERS (auto-detects location)
codeowners-cli lint
codeowners-cli lint --json  # Machine-readable output for CI

# Check who owns a file
codeowners-cli check src/main.rs

# Show coverage stats
codeowners-cli coverage

# Format CODEOWNERS file
codeowners-cli fmt                    # Prints formatted output
codeowners-cli fmt --write            # Writes in place

# Auto-fix safe issues
codeowners-cli fix                    # Preview fixes
codeowners-cli fix --write            # Apply fixes

# Validate owners against GitHub API
codeowners-cli validate-owners        # Uses GITHUB_TOKEN env var
codeowners-cli validate-owners --token ghp_xxx

# Show all files color-coded by owner
codeowners-cli tree

# Generate shell completions
codeowners-cli completions zsh       # zsh, zsh, fish, powershell, elvish
```

## LSP Features

### In Any File

- **Hover**: Shows file ownership with clickable GitHub links and rich metadata (team descriptions, member counts, user bios)
- **Inlay Hints**: Displays ownership at the top of each file
- **Go-to-Definition**: Jump to the CODEOWNERS rule that matches the current file
- **Code Actions**: Take ownership of files directly from your editor

### In CODEOWNERS File

- **Diagnostics**:
  - Invalid glob patterns
  - Invalid owner format (@user, @org/team, or email)
  - Patterns matching no files
  - Duplicate/shadowed rules (dead code)
  - Rules with no owners
  - Coverage: count of files without owners
- **Completions**:
  - fzf-style fuzzy path completions (e.g., `s/m` matches `src/main.rs`)
  - Owner completions from GitHub API with background validation (trigger: `@`)
- **Inlay Hints**: Shows how many files each pattern matches
- **Code Lens**: Inline file count and owners above each rule
- **Document Symbols**: Outline view with sections and rules (Cmd+Shift+O)
- **Workspace Symbols**: Search patterns and owners across file (Cmd+T)
- **Folding**: Collapse comment blocks and sections
- **Semantic Highlighting**: Syntax colors for patterns, owners, globs, comments
- **Find References**: Find all rules containing an owner
- **Rename**: Rename an owner across all rules
- **Signature Help**: Pattern syntax documentation while typing (`*`, `**`, `?`, `[...]`)
- **Selection Range**: Smart expand selection (word → owner → all owners → rule → section)
- **Linked Editing**: Edit an owner and all occurrences update simultaneously
- **Pattern Hover**: Hover over patterns to see matching files
- **Code Actions**:
  - Remove shadowed rules
  - Remove duplicate owners
  - Add owner to empty rules
  - Add catch-all rule for unowned files
- **GitHub Validation** (optional): Validates users/teams exist on GitHub

All heavy operations (file scanning, pattern matching, GitHub API calls) run in background threads—the LSP never blocks your editor.

## Installation

### mise (recommended)

```zsh
mise use -g github:radiosilence/codeowners-lsp@latest
```

### Manual

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/radiosilence/codeowners-lsp/releases).

```zsh
codeowners-lsp  # Communicates over stdio
```

### Zed

Use the [codeowners-zed](https://github.com/radiosilence/codeowners-zed) extension (handles installation automatically).

## Configuration

The LSP finds CODEOWNERS in standard locations: `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `CODEOWNERS`, `docs/CODEOWNERS`.

### Config File

Create `.codeowners-lsp.toml` in your workspace root. For user-specific overrides (gitignore this), use `.codeowners-lsp.local.toml`.

```toml
# CODEOWNERS location (relative to workspace root)
path = "custom/CODEOWNERS"

# Your identifiers for "take ownership" actions
individual = "@username"
team = "@org/team-name"

# GitHub validation (optional)
github_token = "env:GITHUB_TOKEN"
validate_owners = false

# Diagnostic severity overrides
# Values: "off", "hint", "info", "warning", "error"
[diagnostics]
invalid-pattern = "error"        # default: error
invalid-owner = "error"          # default: error
pattern-no-match = "warning"     # default: warning
duplicate-owner = "warning"      # default: warning
shadowed-rule = "warning"        # default: warning
no-owners = "off"                # default: hint
unowned-files = "info"           # default: info
github-owner-not-found = "warning"  # default: warning
```

### LSP Initialization Options

JSON settings can also be passed via LSP init options (these override TOML config):

```json
{
  "path": "custom/CODEOWNERS",
  "individual": "@username",
  "team": "@org/team-name",
  "github_token": "env:GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "validate_owners": false,
  "diagnostics": {
    "no-owners": "off"
  }
}
```
