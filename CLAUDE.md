# codeowners-lsp

Rust LSP for CODEOWNERS with diagnostics, navigation, and code actions.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build          # dev build
cargo build --release
cargo clippy         # NO warnings allowed
cargo fmt            # always run after changes
cargo bench          # run full benchmark suite
cargo bench --bench parsing  # run a single benchmark group
./scripts/bench-summary.sh   # print summary table from last run
```

Using `tower-lsp`. The `codeowners` crate handles matching (read-only), we handle parsing/validation/writes ourselves.

Key structs:

- `Backend` - LSP server state, implements `LanguageServer` trait
- `Settings` - config from init options
- `CodeownersLine` / `ParsedLine` - parsed line representation with positions
- `FileCache` - cached file list for pattern matching
- `GitHubClient` - GitHub API with persistent caching

## LSP Capabilities

**Any file:**

- Hover: ownership info with GitHub metadata
- Inlay hints: ownership at line 0
- Go-to-definition: jump to matching CODEOWNERS rule
- Code actions: take ownership (individual/team/custom)

**CODEOWNERS file:**

- Diagnostics: invalid patterns, invalid owners, no matches, dead rules, coverage
- Inlay hints: file match count per rule
- Code lens: inline file count + owners above rules
- Document symbols: outline view with sections
- Workspace symbols: search patterns/owners
- Folding ranges: collapse comment blocks and sections
- Semantic tokens: syntax highlighting
- Find references: find all rules with an owner
- Rename: rename owner across all rules
- Signature help: pattern syntax docs while typing
- Selection range: smart expand selection
- Linked editing: edit owner in all places at once
- Code actions: remove dead rules, dedupe owners, add catch-all

## Config

```json
{
  "path": "custom/CODEOWNERS",
  "individual": "@username",
  "team": "@org/team-name",
  "github_token": "env:GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "validate_owners": false
}
```

## Key Gotchas

- Shared code lives in `src/lib.rs` (lib crate); binaries re-export via `pub use`
- `#[allow(dead_code)]` still needed for functions only called from one binary context
- GitHub usernames: alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only (NO periods)
- CODEOWNERS does NOT support `[...]` character classes or `!` negation (unlike gitignore)
- Owner matching in handlers must use forward search with word boundaries, not `find()`/`rfind()`
- `check_file_ownership_parsed()` exists for hot loops; `check_file_ownership()` re-parses each call
