# Changelog

## [0.12.2] - 2026-02-03

### Known Bugs

- **File diagnostics don't update with content changes** - Diagnostics for non-CODEOWNERS files can get stuck (e.g. highlighting half the file after adding lines)
- **Code actions intermittently disappear** - Actions sometimes appear once then stop showing. Seems to affect `.toml` config files more than others - may be IDE-related

### Ideas / Future

- **Snazzier coverage output** - Colors, maybe a graph
- **Lint: show full uncovered files list** - Currently shows a summary, should show complete list

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Linux musl builds** - Static binaries for x86_64 and aarch64 musl targets, useful for Alpine Linux and containers.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **`coverage` file filtering for CI** - Check ownership of specific files instead of the whole repo:
  ```bash
  codeowners-cli coverage --files src/new.rs src/other.rs
  codeowners-cli coverage --files-from changed_files.txt
  git diff --name-only origin/main | codeowners-cli coverage --stdin
  ```

- **`coverage` now exits non-zero** - Returns exit code 1 if any checked files are unowned. Useful for CI to enforce ownership on new files.

- **`lint --strict`** - Exit non-zero on warnings, not just errors. Useful for stricter CI checks.

- **`validate-owners` file filtering** - Only validate owners for rules matching specific files:
  ```bash
  codeowners-cli validate-owners --files src/new.rs src/other.rs
  codeowners-cli validate-owners --files-from changed_files.txt
  git diff --name-only origin/main | codeowners-cli validate-owners --stdin
  ```

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **CLI `lint` now respects diagnostic config** - Diagnostic severity overrides from `.codeowners-lsp.toml` now work in CLI, not just LSP.

- **File discovery now uses `git ls-files`** - Switched from walking filesystem with ignore rules to using git's index. Only git-tracked files are considered for pattern matching and coverage. Fixes `.codeowners-lsp.toml` being incorrectly excluded from ownership checks.

- **`file-not-owned` vs `no-owners` are now distinct** - Previously both cases showed the same error. Now:
  - `file-not-owned` (default: error) - No CODEOWNERS rule matches the file
  - `no-owners` (default: hint) - A rule matches but has no owners specified
  
  This allows disabling one without the other:
  ```toml
  [diagnostics]
  no-owners = "off"        # Don't warn about catch-all rules with no owners
  file-not-owned = "error" # Still error on files with no matching rule
  ```

### Changed

- **Internal: Unified settings module** - CLI and LSP now share config loading code.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-03

### Changed

- **Config: `[suggest]` section** - `lookup_cmd` moved into `[suggest]` section. Update your config:
  ```toml
  # Before
  lookup_cmd = "..."
  
  # After
  [suggest]
  lookup_cmd = "..."
  anchored = true  # optional: prepend / to paths
  ```

- **`fix` command removed** - Use `lint --fix` instead.

### Added

- **`suggest --anchored`** - Prepend `/` to suggested paths (anchored patterns). Also available via config.
- **`lint --fix`** - Auto-fix safe issues (duplicate owners, shadowed rules, no-match patterns).
- **Remove no-match patterns** - Both `lint --fix` and `optimize` now remove patterns that match no files.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **`optimize --write` now works in single pass** - Fixed bug where directory consolidation would create new patterns that were immediately shadowed by catch-all rules like `*`. Consolidations are now skipped if the resulting pattern would be shadowed, eliminating the need for multiple passes.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Catch-all `*` now correctly shadows ALL previous rules** - Fixed bug where duplicate catch-all detection prevented subsumption checks, so `* @default` at end of file now properly marks all previous rules as shadowed

## [0.10.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Performance: skip subsumption checks for non-subsuming patterns** - Only check shadowing when current pattern could actually subsume others (wildcards, directories), reducing O(n²) to O(n×m) where m is number of wildcards/directories

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **LSP diagnostics now detect all shadowed rules** - Previously only tracked wildcards/directories for shadowing detection, missing exact file patterns like `/src/foo.rs` being shadowed by `*`

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed - Critical Pattern Matching Overhaul

Complete rewrite of pattern matching to conform to GitHub CODEOWNERS behavior:

- **Anchored vs unanchored patterns** - Leading `/` now properly anchors to root
  - `/docs/` only matches `docs/` at repository root
  - `docs/` (no leading `/`) matches ANY `docs/` directory anywhere in the tree
  - This was a major bug: `docs/` was incorrectly treated as anchored

- **`/*` now correctly matches only root files** - Previously matched everything

- **Catch-all behavior** - `*` and `**` now correctly match all files at any depth

- **Directory pattern semantics**:
  - `/docs/` = anchored, recursive (matches `docs/**`)
  - `/docs/*` = anchored, direct children only (NOT subdirectories)
  - `docs/` = unanchored, matches anywhere in tree

### Changed - Optimize Command

The `optimize` command now uses the corrected pattern engine:

- **Detects shadowed rules using `pattern_subsumes`** - Properly detects when later rules shadow earlier ones based on "last match wins" semantics
- **Catches common footguns**:
  - `docs/ @team` followed by `* @default` → `docs/` is dead
  - `/src/auth/ @security` followed by `/src/ @backend` → `/src/auth/` is dead
  - Unanchored patterns are NOT shadowed by anchored equivalents

- **Directory consolidation** - Only suggests when ALL files in directory have exact same owners

- **Removed risky glob suggestions** - No longer suggests `*.rs` patterns that might match unintended files

### Added - `suggest` command with `lookup_cmd`

- **`lookup_cmd` config option** - External command to resolve email → team/owner
  ```toml
  lookup_cmd = "your-tool lookup {email} | jq -r .team"
  ```
- **Parallel lookups** - Batch email resolution with progress bar
- **Weighted voting** - Aggregates contributors' teams by commit count
- **Fuzzy matching** - Matches lookup results against existing CODEOWNERS owners
- **`--write` flag** - Adds suggestions directly to CODEOWNERS at smart insertion points

### Added - 51 new pattern conformance tests

Comprehensive test suite covering all GitHub CODEOWNERS behaviors:
- Catch-all patterns, extension patterns, anchored/unanchored directories
- Single vs double star wildcards, case sensitivity
- Dead rule detection scenarios, edge cases

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **`optimize --write` no longer causes shadowing** - optimized patterns now replace the original rules in-place instead of being appended at the end of the file, which was causing catch-all rules to shadow the optimizations

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **`suggest` command** - Suggests owners for unowned files based on git commit history
  - Analyzes `git shortlog` to find who commits most to files/directories
  - Converts GitHub emails to @username format automatically
  - Confidence scoring based on commit frequency and volume
  - Multiple output formats: `--format human|codeowners|json`
  - Configurable confidence threshold: `--min-confidence 30`

- **`optimize` command** - Suggests ways to simplify CODEOWNERS patterns
  - Detects multiple file rules that could be a single directory pattern
  - Finds patterns with same extension in same directory → glob pattern
  - Identifies redundant/shadowed rules for removal
  - Multiple output formats: `--format human|codeowners|json`

- **Git blame analysis module** (`src/blame.rs`)
  - Analyzes git history per-file and per-directory
  - Aggregates contributor statistics with commit counts
  - Smart owner format conversion (GitHub noreply emails → @username)

### Example Usage

```bash
# Suggest owners for unowned files
codeowners-cli suggest
codeowners-cli suggest --min-confidence 50 --format codeowners

# Find optimization opportunities
codeowners-cli optimize
codeowners-cli optimize --format json --min-files 5
```

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-02

- **Signature Help** - pattern syntax documentation while typing glob characters (`*`, `**`, `?`, `[...]`)
- **Selection Range** - smart expand selection: word → owner → all owners → whole rule → section → file
- **Linked Editing** - edit an @owner and all occurrences in the file update simultaneously
- **Pattern Hover** - hover over patterns to see list of matching files (up to 10 shown)
- **Related Diagnostics** - "shadowed rule" diagnostics now link to the shadowing rule for quick navigation

### Changed

- **New handler modules** - `handlers/signature.rs`, `handlers/selection.rs`, `handlers/linked.rs`

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Document Symbols** - outline view of CODEOWNERS file with sections and rules (Cmd+Shift+O)
- **Workspace Symbols** - search patterns and owners across the file (Cmd+T)
- **Folding Ranges** - collapse comment blocks and section headers
- **Semantic Tokens** - syntax highlighting for patterns, @users, @org/teams, glob characters, comments
- **Find All References** - find all rules containing a specific owner
- **Rename Symbol** - rename an @owner across all rules in one operation
- **Code Lens** - inline display showing file count and owners above each rule

### Changed

- **Refactored handler code** - LSP handlers now in `src/handlers/` module for cleaner organization:
  - `handlers/symbols.rs` - document and workspace symbols
  - `handlers/navigation.rs` - references, rename
  - `handlers/semantic.rs` - semantic tokens, folding ranges
  - `handlers/lens.rs` - code lens

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **CLI lint validates owners** - `codeowners-cli lint` now validates GitHub owners if `validate_owners = true` in config
- **Respects persistent cache** - CLI uses and updates the same cache as LSP, checks staleness (24h)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **No CODEOWNERS = no complaints** - file-not-owned diagnostics only shown when CODEOWNERS file actually exists

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **Release includes both binaries** - `codeowners-cli` now included in release tarballs alongside `codeowners-lsp`

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Real-time pattern validation** - patterns are checked against file cache as you type, instant feedback on whether a pattern matches any files
- **mise installation** - `mise use -g github:radiosilence/codeowners-lsp@latest`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-02

### Performance

- **Non-blocking LSP main loop** - all heavy work (file scanning, pattern matching, GitHub validation) now runs in background threads via `spawn_blocking`, so the editor never lags
- **Pattern match caching** - file match counts are cached per-pattern, making repeated inlay hints/diagnostics instant
- **Inlay hints only compute visible range** - instead of computing all 3000+ lines, only computes hints for lines actually on screen
- **29x faster on large repos** - combined optimizations turn 20+ second delays into sub-second responses

### Added

- **Rich hover for @owners in CODEOWNERS** - hover over any @user or @org/team to see profile info, bio, team description, member counts, with avatars (in supported editors)
- **fzf-style fuzzy path completion** - type `s/m` to match `src/main.rs`, scores: exact prefix > substring > fuzzy
- **Background GitHub validation** - new owners are validated async on save, fetches full metadata for rich hover
- **Internal ignore list** - LSP config files (`.codeowners-lsp.toml`, `.codeowners-lsp/`) excluded from file-not-owned diagnostics
- **Persistent metadata cache** - GitHub user/team info cached to `.codeowners-lsp/cache.json` with auto-gitignore

### Fixed

- **Autocomplete replaces instead of appends** - completion items now use proper `text_edit` with replacement range
- **CODEOWNERS changes detected live** - editing CODEOWNERS buffer updates diagnostics immediately (not just on save)
- **Inlay hints refresh on CODEOWNERS change** - ownership hints in other files update when CODEOWNERS is modified
- **Path completion works without leading `/`** - `src/main` and `/src/main` both work correctly

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **`file-not-owned` diagnostic** - files without CODEOWNERS entry show full-file error (impossible to miss!)
  - Default severity: `error`, configurable via `[diagnostics] file-not-owned = "off"` to disable
  - Existing "Take ownership" code actions work with this diagnostic
- **Smart insertion point** for new CODEOWNERS entries:
  - Inserts near rules with similar directory prefixes
  - Falls back to inserting near other rules by same owner
  - Inserts before catch-all rules (`*`, `/**`)
- **CLI: `config`** - show config file paths and merged settings (like `mise config`)

### Changed

- `validate-owners` now runs requests in parallel (5 concurrent) with progress bar

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Colorized CLI output** - all commands now use colored output for better readability

### Fixed

- **CLI: `tree`** - show all files color-coded by owner (uses ANSI colors)
- **CLI: `completions`** - generate shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, powershell, elvish
- **CLI uses clap** - proper argument parsing with help, version, and better error messages

### Fixed

- `.git` directory now excluded from file cache (was causing issues with coverage/completions)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Config file support** - `.codeowners-lsp.toml` for project settings, `.codeowners-lsp.local.toml` for user overrides
- **Configurable diagnostic severities** - disable or change severity of any diagnostic rule via `[diagnostics]` section
  - Supports: `off`, `hint`, `info`, `warning`, `error`
  - Example: `no-owners = "off"` to disable the no-owners hint

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **"Fix all safe issues"** code action in LSP - one-click fix for all auto-fixable issues

### Changed

- Refactored shared logic into `ownership.rs` module (cleaner codebase)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **`fix` command** in CLI - auto-fix safe issues (duplicate owners, shadowed rules)
- **`textDocument/formatting`** in LSP - editors like Zed can now use CODEOWNERS-LSP as formatter
- **Clickable owner links** in hover - `@user` and `@org/team` now link to GitHub profiles/teams

### Changed

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-02

### Changed

- **29x faster linting** via compiled patterns, fast-glob crate, and optimized algorithms (4.8s → 165ms on 3800-rule repos)

- **Owner completions** - autocomplete owners from GitHub API (when `validate_owners` enabled)
- **`fmt` command** in CLI - format/normalize CODEOWNERS files

### Changed

- **Shadowed rules now show as warnings** instead of hints (visible in editors by default)

### Fixed

- Glob patterns like `/**/file.json`, `deployment/*/deploy/**`, and `*crowdin*` now match correctly

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-02
